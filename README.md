## üöÄ Quick Start

Prerequisites:
- A Google Sheet (you can create your own with columns A‚ÄìJ)
- Node.js and npm installed
- Google account access to Apps Script

1. Install clasp and log in:
```bash
npm install -g @google/clasp
clasp login
````

2. Link this project to your Apps Script (container-bound Sheet):
- In your Sheet: Extensions -> Apps Script (creates a bound script)
- Then get the Script ID from Apps Script: Project Settings -> Script ID

```bash
clasp clone <SCRIPT_ID>
```

3. Configure Script Properties (in Apps Script: File -> Project properties -> Script properties):

* SHEET\_ID = your Google Sheet ID
* DEFAULT\_DELAY = 2000
* MAX\_RETRIES = 3

4. Run:

* Refresh the Sheet. The script triggers on paste into Column J.
